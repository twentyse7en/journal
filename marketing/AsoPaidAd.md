# ASO, Paid Ads, and Organic Growth – Notes

---

## 1. ASO (App Store Optimization) & Main Focus Areas

### What is ASO

* ASO is the process of improving an app’s visibility in app stores (App Store / Play Store) to increase downloads.
* Objective: more impressions → more page visits → more installs (without directly paying per install).

### Main ASO Focus Areas

* **Keyword optimization**

  * Select relevant search keywords for the app.
  * Balance keyword popularity, competition, and opportunity.
* **Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)**

  * Improve the percentage of users who install after landing on the app page.
  * Optimize app icon, screenshots, preview video, and store creatives.
* **App presence optimization**

  * Increase impressions using app events, special offers, and featuring opportunities.

## 2. Why ASO Is Important

### Importance Before Running Paid Ads

* Every user (paid or organic) must land on the app page before installing.
* A well-optimized store page improves conversion rates.
* Higher conversion rates reduce **CPI (Cost Per Install)**.
* Strong ASO helps improve keyword rankings and overall campaign efficiency.

### App Page Readiness Check

* Compare conversion rates with category benchmarks.
* If conversion is low:

  * Pause or limit paid campaigns.
  * Improve store listing and creatives.
  * Restart campaigns once ASO is stronger.

## 3. Effect of Paid Ad Campaigns

### Direct Effects

* Rapid increase in daily install volume.
* Faster visibility in targeted countries or regions.

### Indirect Effects

* Improvement in keyword rankings.
* Better category rankings.
* Increased discoverability and potential featuring.

### Observations from Real Examples

* New apps can move from zero visibility to hundreds of ranked keywords.
* Mature apps can significantly boost category rankings by increasing daily installs.

## 4. How Paid Ads Affect Organic Growth

### Organic Uplift Mechanism

* Higher daily installs signal app store algorithms.
* Improved rankings lead to more organic search and browse traffic.
* Organic traffic often grows in parallel with paid campaigns.

### Limitations of Organic Uplift

* Some organic installs may actually be delayed paid conversions.
* Organic uplift often drops quickly when paid campaigns stop.
* Paid ads alone do not guarantee sustainable organic growth.

## 5. Criteria to Continue Paid Ads

### Key Decision Factors

* Continue campaigns if:

  * Increased installs lead to higher organic installs.
  * Organic installs generate higher organic revenue.
  * Combined paid + organic revenue meets profitability goals.

* Stop or reduce campaigns if:

  * Organic installs increase but organic revenue does not.
  * No noticeable organic uplift appears despite higher spend.

### Recommended Testing Approach

* Run short-term tests (results visible within ~1 week).
* Monitor:

  * Store conversion rate
  * CPI trends
  * Keyword and category rankings
  * Organic installs and revenue baseline
* Scale spend only if long-term profitability improves.
