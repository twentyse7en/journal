# Social Media Growth Guide
This is a summary of [Jack Fricks](https://www.post-bridge.com/growth-guide/start-here) growth guide for organic social media marketing

# Step 1: Account creation
- Create a brand new account
- Comeup with a bio that turns views into traffic

## Bio Example
<img width="470" height="209" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ebbe39-4dc7-4fa6-98bb-7a85feea37d8" />
<img width="502" height="204" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/812f875b-60b1-4739-b9cc-d8ed0c8089b5" />


The main goal with your bio is to make sure anyone who reads it knows how to get your thing, or to your site, and WHY they should go there.

For TikTok you can't put links on new accounts so just type in the URL or app name instead. Instagram put app store link or website directly by making it a business/creator account.

## Step 1 Checklist: Day 1
- [ ] Create ONE TikTok account
- [ ] Create ONE Instagram account
- [ ] Make a bio that turns views into traffic

# Step 2: Account Warmup Protocol
> ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT POST FOR 7 DAYS!
- Don't post anything
- Engage like a human, so algo don't flag you as bot
  
## Step 2 Checklist: Day 2 - 8
- [ ] 15 min scrolling each platform + comment, reply and follow relevant accounts
- [ ] Save 3-5 videos you can recreate per day

# Step 3: Content Market Fit
## What you're looking for
You want to find your "winning format" - the type of content that consistently gets 1000+ views and comments from people who could/would actually use your product (your ICP).

## How do you find a winning format? Where do you start?
- When you do make a video: Make sure the first comment, or caption or end of video Call to action (CTA) is related/relevant to your app. If you just want views but no downloads, whats the use of this? When you make a video, atleast the caption should mention your business.

- Most important here is to not overdo it. do not make videos that look like ads. No one wants to feel like their being sold to.
- NEXT! boring! no value! Make content that brings the views something of value: Educate them, entertain them, make them feel seen or heard. Relate to them, fix their problems, make them laugh, make them feel something. DO NOT MAKE VIDEOS THAT FEEL LIKE ADS.

- Once you find a winning format, double down on it. Each apps "winning format" is unique and this may take more than a month to find a true winner.

- **Aim for short videos as algo LOVESSS watch time and comments. These are your two goals. MAKE content that drives comments and watch time**

## Step 2 Checklist: Day 8 - 30
- [ ] Post ONLY 1 video per day (quality over quantity!)
- [ ] Focus on watch time and comments - these are your two main goals

- Try [capcut](https://youtu.be/pHMoPh6mzm4)
- Step 2: Get the viral audio/music
- Step 3: Recreate the format of viral video
  - Keep the EXACT same hook and format
  - Change the context to your business/app
  - Use the same music/audio
  - End with a CTA that mentions your app naturally or ONLY put the CTA in the caption and comments. It's easier to build momentum when you arent hard selling too early.
- Focus on what matters
  - **Watch Time**: Hook people in the first 3 seconds, the goal is to get them to watch as close to 100% of the video as possible, but if they leave in the first second then its over.
  - **Comments**: Spark discussion by making interesting or relatable content. Good content is king, always. Provide value and make every video a little bit better than the last.
