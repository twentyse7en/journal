# Journal
## Introduction
- *Why?* ans: I read a lot, explore new technologies. I want to keep that in **chronological order**.
- *why not existing blog?* ([blog1](https://twentyse7en.vercel.app/) [blog2](https://twentyse7en.github.io/)) ans: blog feels more formal, I didn't find fun in putting effort in writing a finished blog.
- *what to expect?* ans: I currently working in mobile development (react native), previously web development (react), so can expect anything around that (this could change in future)
- *where else I take note?* ans: Obsidian, It's awsome. I primarily write on Obsidian, copy that content here. Here I can track what I did in which day. Track my evolution.
