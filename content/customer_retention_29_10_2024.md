# Focus and Customer Retention

Noting down points from [podcast](https://youtu.be/BJ2f8wSeccU?t=2126). In this podcast Founder of [Zoko](https://www.zoko.io/) shares his insights about Customer Retention.

## Focus

- Some how get first 100 customers, personal message, call, anything, **who loves your product**
- Find next one channel like Google Ads, Cold Mail to get next set of customer like the first 100 Customers. **Focus** on one channel, don't spread time. Put your time on building product.
- Communicate with other founders through community to understand what they are doing, what didn't workout for Them. This helps to understand what things to be done on each stage of growth.
- Zoko Reached 25 Crores Revenue (yearly) with E-mail marketing

## Customer Retention
- Is onboarded customer paying for 12 Months, is the purchase volume increasing?
- **"Leaky Bucket Problem"** - Even if you onboard more customer, there will be a set customer which is leaving (leak). If leak is high, it's difficult to grow.
- People who didn't solve *Leaky bucket problem* have no right to spend money on marketing and ads.
- Zoko started marketing after they got 80% retention. If 100 users are onboarder 80 user pay for 12 months or more, 20 don't. 80% is good.

- For a good company, people will drop off and eventually, it will stop. At the end you have some customer. For bad product, people keep drop off and there will be no users left. This idea is from a YC session he attended, hope [this](https://youtu.be/VNxBZ7ka5J0) have similar content.
- Keeping retention is difficult thing. That's why software valuation are so high. If a software product have 1Cr revenue this year, If you need to buy that product you need to pay 20Cr.
