# Hermes
One of the things I have seen in multiple place in React Native world is Hermes. In some configuration file, [optimization](https://medium.com/engineering-udaan/reacting-to-change-tale-of-a-web-developer-improving-startup-performance-for-a-large-react-native-854f8a4850fd) blogs. This was never heard in React World. It will be 3x boosting your start up app speed, by just enabling it, let's see what black magic is that.

# Basics
- A new javascript engine (like v8).  
So what was the previous engine?  
From [docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/javascript-environment), if hermes is disabled, it will javascriptcore. Apple Safari's engine.
- Designed for mobile environments.
- Focused on startup performance

# What's special About mobile?
- Less Memory
- Less storage
- High I/O Latency

# What's different on hermes?
Many stuffs happen on **Run Time**

In hermes, may stuffs happens before **Run time**, less things happen in user's device, more fast.
