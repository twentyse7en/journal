# The art of tech career?
I'm first time reading a different approach to software engineer career. [Sean Goedecke](https://www.seangoedecke.com/) takes are interesting. These are just summaries of his different blogs.

# Navigating Tech Job Security in Uncertain Times
In the current tech climate, where job security is uncertain and companies prioritize visible output over work-life balance, engineers must adapt strategically. Rather than merely extending work hours (which risks burnout and reduced effectiveness), focus on high-impact, visible projects that align with company priorities.

## Key Tactics:

1. Cut "Unpaid Work": Minimize non-essential tasks like excessive testing, refactoring, or unrequested cross-team help. These activities, while valuable, are often invisible to leadership and can be deprioritized under pressure.

2. Prioritize Crucial Projects: Identify high-stakes work (e.g., projects highlighted in company-wide updates or involving senior leadership) and allocate intense effort during these periods. Treat these sprints as temporary, followed by rest to avoid burnout.

3. Balance Effort: Work intensely during critical phases but scale back afterward. Sustainability hinges on alternating periods of focus with recovery.

Rationale: Companies measure productivity by **visible output**, not hours logged. By focusing on legible contributions and strategically neglecting less visible tasks, engineers can protect their roles while maintaining personal well-being. Acknowledge that some technical debt or process gaps may arise, but these trade-offs prioritize survival in a pressured environment.

# Knowing where your engineer salary comes from
The article argues that software engineers often misunderstand the link between their work and their company's profitability, leading to job instability. Tech companies prioritize profit, so engineers must align their tasks with revenue generation. Common pitfalls include focusing on non-revenue work (e.g., tech debt, accessibility improvements) without recognizing their indirect profit ties. Engineers are advised to:

1. **Understand the company’s business model** (e.g., Valve’s revenue via Steam vs. games) and how their role supports it.

2. **Connect their work to profit centers**, even indirectly (e.g., accessibility may expand customer bases or meet regulatory needs).

3. **Join large, profitable companies** if pursuing non-core projects, as marginal gains (e.g., 2% growth at Google) justify costs.

The author critiques the naive belief that companies inherently value "good features" (clean code, accessibility) without profit motives. During economic downturns or leadership changes, non-revenue roles risk cuts. Stability requires demonstrating value to profit centers, rather than relying on goodwill or cultural trends. Ultimately, engineers must proactively align their work with business goals to avoid disillusionment or job loss.

# Value over replacement in software engineering
The article explores two methods for evaluating a software engineer’s contributions: total value (direct financial impact of their work) and value over replacement (unique contributions beyond what a typical peer could deliver).

- **Total value** measures the revenue or profit generated by an engineer’s output (e.g., a feature generating $5M/year). This metric is practical for assessing if compensation aligns with tangible results.

- **Value over replacement** evaluates how an engineer’s distinct skills, proactive problem-solving, speed, or expertise added exceptional value. For example, initiating impactful projects or being requested for specialized tasks highlights this.

While total value is more straightforward, value over replacement is subjective and prone to bias but critical for promotions. The article stresses that engineers should aim to deliver positive value in specific areas to counterbalance potential weaknesses elsewhere. Recognizing which metric to use—whether for justifying pay or advancement—requires clarity about context and honest self-assessment of one’s unique impact.

# Prioritizing Work at Tech Companies 
- Focus on rare, high-impact projects ("spotlight" initiatives) aligned with leadership priorities.  
- Missing these opportunities harms visibility, team, and company execution.  
- Avoid low-value work (e.g., unnecessary refactors, misaligned demos).  
- Use "lab days" for self-directed, outcome-focused projects.  
- Build credit with managers/peers by solving real problems.  
- Choosing impactful work is a skill—practice intentional decision-making.  

## Strategies for Non-Critical Periods
- **Own your time**: Use lab days/20% time to:
  - **Ship small, visible wins** (e.g., UX tweaks, automation scripts) for promo/resume bullets.
- **Treat side projects like experiments**
> If you spend an afternoon on one of your own goals, and it doesn’t provide value, that wasted time is on you. It’s as if you spent the afternoon playing video games. Once you realize that, it forces you to become more agentic, which has all kinds of benefits for your career.

# Playing politics is how senior engineers protect their team
The article argues that senior engineers in large tech companies have a responsibility to engage in organizational politics to protect and advance their teams, particularly junior members. Key points include:

1. **Team Success & Reputation**: A team’s failure jeopardizes all members’ reputations. Senior engineers must prioritize high-impact projects aligned with company goals to ensure their team remains visible and valued, avoiding layoffs or marginalization.

2. **Impact on Juniors**:
    - Visibility & Promotions: Juniors depend on high-profile work for career advancement, as they’re often in “up-or-out” roles. Seniors must secure impactful projects and advocate for their team’s contributions.

    - Job Security: If a team fails, juniors face greater career risks (e.g., layoffs, difficulty finding new roles) compared to seniors.

3. **Political Clout & Advocacy**: Senior engineers’ credibility with management amplifies juniors’ achievements. Avoiding politics undermines their ability to highlight team efforts, reducing promotion opportunities for juniors.

4. **Moral Responsibility**: Rejecting corporate goals as “bullshit” harms the team. Effective political engagement is framed as ethical—protecting juniors’ careers—rather than cynical self-interest.

# How I got promoted to staff engineer twice
The author shares insights from being promoted to staff engineer at two companies (Zendesk and GitHub) within two years, highlighting strategies for advancing from senior to staff engineer:

## Key Drivers for Promotion
1. **Strategic Value to Leadership:**
    - Promotions occur primarily to retain high-value engineers or empower them to lead critical cross-organizational projects.

    - Technical prowess or mentoring alone are insufficient; delivering measurable business impact is essential.

2. **Alignment with Company Priorities:**

    - Focus on projects that address the company’s current goals (e.g., enterprise features, reliability improvements).

    - Avoid prioritizing personal or non-aligned initiatives, even if technically impressive.

3. **Outcome Over Effort**:
    - Success is judged by project results, not effort. Technical competence is critical to drive projects to completion.

**Role of Leadership and Mentoring**:
While leadership and mentoring are part of the role, they are secondary to shipping high-impact work. Mentoring gains traction when it directly supports company objectives (e.g., team growth during expansion).

**Environmental Factors** 
- Company Structure: Staff roles must exist, and budgets must allow for promotions.

- Managerial Support: A proactive manager is crucial to advocate, align projects, and navigate promotion processes.

- Organizational Buy-In: Skip-level managers and existing staff engineers must endorse the promotion, requiring a strong reputation.

**Practical Advice**

- Switch Companies if Necessary: Landing a staff role externally is often easier than internal promotion.

- Avoid Politics: Focus on visible, impactful work rather than campaigning for promotion without results.



# What it's like working for American companies as an Australian
> Australia does have a healthy tech sector, but it’s nothing compared to America’s. If I lived in San Francisco, I’d have ~100x more available jobs to apply to if I lost my current one.  
> For this reason, I operate a little less idealistically and a little more tactically than I would in an Australian-based company.

# What makes strong engineers strong?
Strong engineers excel due to four key traits, prioritized as follows:

Self-Belief: Confidence to tackle unfamiliar or complex problems head-on, even amid uncertainty. This mindset avoids procrastination, fosters resilience, and creates a feedback loop where tackling hard tasks builds further confidence. Strong engineers trust their ability to solve problems or recognize when challenges are insurmountable.

Pragmatism: Focus on practical, functional solutions over theoretical perfection. They prioritize shipping results, often clashing with engineers who over-optimize for elegance. Decisions are judged by real-world impact, not abstraction or neatness, with compromises made to deliver efficiently.

Speed: Rapid execution driven by confronting hard tasks immediately and accumulating experience through iterative work. Speed enables experimentation, testing high-reward ideas, and tackling qualitatively different challenges. It stems from focused productivity bursts, not long hours, though exceptional individuals may combine both.

Technical Ability: Baseline competence is essential, but effectiveness hinges on alignment between skills and project needs (e.g., familiarity with specific tools or domains). Raw genius is less critical than adaptability; overly technical engineers may lack pragmatism or speed, hindering results.

# Grifters, believers, grinders, and coasters
The article explores four archetypes of engineers—grifters, believers, grinders, and coasters—to explain workplace conflicts and advocate for a balanced team dynamic. Each type approaches work differently, reflecting distinct values and strategies:

1. **Grifters**: Tactically align with leadership priorities to advance projects and their careers. They excel in navigating organizational politics, securing buy-in, and delivering results that align with rewards. However, they may perpetuate existing culture without driving change and avoid unrewarded critical work.

2. **Believers**: Prioritize mission-driven, quality work and user experience over politics. They uphold ethical standards and customer focus but may resist organizational shifts, risking alienation during company pivots. Often under-promoted due to rejecting "game-playing."

3. **Coasters**: Work efficiently, avoiding unnecessary effort. They maintain calm, handle ad-hoc tasks, and rely on "hammock time" (reflective problem-solving). While stabilizing teams, they may lack urgency for high-volume workloads.

4. **Grinders**: Relentlessly productive, tackling tasks with intensity. They deliver quickly but risk burnout and may overlook broader context. Common among juniors, but sustainability issues push many toward coasting over time.

The author argues that healthy organizations blend these types: Grifters secure resources, Believers safeguard mission and quality, Grinders drive output, and Coasters provide flexibility. Conflicts arise from clashing values (e.g., Believers vs. Grifters on ethics vs. pragmatism), but mutual understanding is key. Advice includes Grifters collaborating with Believers to prevent cultural decay, Believers choosing mission-aligned companies, Grinders tolerating Coasters (as they may evolve into them), and Coasters appreciating Grinders’ contributions. Ultimately, empathy and strategic diversity foster resilience and balance in engineering teams.

*PS*: Author is considering himself as Grifter+Coaster

# What can strong engineers do that weak engineers can't?
The article explores the distinction between strong, regular, and weak software engineers, emphasizing that talent is defined by capability to solve tasks others cannot, not just speed or output. Key points:

1. **Strong Engineers**
    - *Capabilities*: Tackle complex, high-impact tasks others cannot, such as resolving race conditions in distributed systems, reworking legacy codebases, or advancing cutting-edge tech (e.g., self-driving cars).

    - *Impact*: Their value is not linear (e.g., "10x") but infinite on certain problems where others fail entirely.

    - *Traits*: Often excel across multiple domains, possibly due to raw skill, problem-solving adaptability, or dedication.

2. **Regular Engineers**
    - *Capabilities*: Handle ~95% of routine tasks (fixing common bugs, delivering standard JIRA tickets) steadily but lack the ability to solve the hardest problems.
    - *Role*: Critical for day-to-day operations; reliable but not exceptional.

3. **Weak Engineers**
    - *Capabilities*: Struggle with even basic tasks, often relying on others to complete their work.
    - *Survival Tactics*:
        - One-way pairing: Constantly seek help from colleagues (e.g., DMs, round-robin requests) while contributing little.
        - Vague participation: Engage in discussions with generic advice rather than concrete, system-specific insights.
        - Seniority paradox: Weak engineers are more common in senior roles due to interview tactics (e.g., claiming credit for team work) and the pressure to hide incompetence.

**Working with Weak Engineers**
- *Be empathetic but protective*: Avoid sacrificing your time to solve their tasks. Redirect requests to next steps instead of providing full solutions.
- *Shield juniors*: Prevent exploitation by ensuring management is aware of unbalanced "mentoring" dynamics.
- *Focus on reality*: Recognize that weak engineers may not be fired quickly due to company processes or unseen personal circumstances.
