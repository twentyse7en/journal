# The art of tech career?
I'm first time reading a different approach to software engineer career. [Sean Goedecke](https://www.seangoedecke.com/) takes are interesting. These are just summaries of his different blogs.

# Navigating Tech Job Security in Uncertain Times
In the current tech climate, where job security is uncertain and companies prioritize visible output over work-life balance, engineers must adapt strategically. Rather than merely extending work hours (which risks burnout and reduced effectiveness), focus on high-impact, visible projects that align with company priorities.

## Key Tactics:

1. Cut "Unpaid Work": Minimize non-essential tasks like excessive testing, refactoring, or unrequested cross-team help. These activities, while valuable, are often invisible to leadership and can be deprioritized under pressure.

2. Prioritize Crucial Projects: Identify high-stakes work (e.g., projects highlighted in company-wide updates or involving senior leadership) and allocate intense effort during these periods. Treat these sprints as temporary, followed by rest to avoid burnout.

3. Balance Effort: Work intensely during critical phases but scale back afterward. Sustainability hinges on alternating periods of focus with recovery.

Rationale: Companies measure productivity by **visible output**, not hours logged. By focusing on legible contributions and strategically neglecting less visible tasks, engineers can protect their roles while maintaining personal well-being. Acknowledge that some technical debt or process gaps may arise, but these trade-offs prioritize survival in a pressured environment.

# Knowing where your engineer salary comes from
The article argues that software engineers often misunderstand the link between their work and their company's profitability, leading to job instability. Tech companies prioritize profit, so engineers must align their tasks with revenue generation. Common pitfalls include focusing on non-revenue work (e.g., tech debt, accessibility improvements) without recognizing their indirect profit ties. Engineers are advised to:

1. **Understand the company’s business model** (e.g., Valve’s revenue via Steam vs. games) and how their role supports it.

2. **Connect their work to profit centers**, even indirectly (e.g., accessibility may expand customer bases or meet regulatory needs).

3. **Join large, profitable companies** if pursuing non-core projects, as marginal gains (e.g., 2% growth at Google) justify costs.

The author critiques the naive belief that companies inherently value "good features" (clean code, accessibility) without profit motives. During economic downturns or leadership changes, non-revenue roles risk cuts. Stability requires demonstrating value to profit centers, rather than relying on goodwill or cultural trends. Ultimately, engineers must proactively align their work with business goals to avoid disillusionment or job loss.

# Value over replacement in software engineering
The article explores two methods for evaluating a software engineer’s contributions: total value (direct financial impact of their work) and value over replacement (unique contributions beyond what a typical peer could deliver).

- **Total value** measures the revenue or profit generated by an engineer’s output (e.g., a feature generating $5M/year). This metric is practical for assessing if compensation aligns with tangible results.

- **Value over replacement** evaluates how an engineer’s distinct skills, proactive problem-solving, speed, or expertise added exceptional value. For example, initiating impactful projects or being requested for specialized tasks highlights this.

While total value is more straightforward, value over replacement is subjective and prone to bias but critical for promotions. The article stresses that engineers should aim to deliver positive value in specific areas to counterbalance potential weaknesses elsewhere. Recognizing which metric to use—whether for justifying pay or advancement—requires clarity about context and honest self-assessment of one’s unique impact.

# Prioritizing Work at Tech Companies 
- Focus on rare, high-impact projects ("spotlight" initiatives) aligned with leadership priorities.  
- Missing these opportunities harms visibility, team, and company execution.  
- Avoid low-value work (e.g., unnecessary refactors, misaligned demos).  
- Use "lab days" for self-directed, outcome-focused projects.  
- Build credit with managers/peers by solving real problems.  
- Choosing impactful work is a skill—practice intentional decision-making.  

## Strategies for Non-Critical Periods
- **Own your time**: Use lab days/20% time to:
  - **Ship small, visible wins** (e.g., UX tweaks, automation scripts) for promo/resume bullets.
- **Treat side projects like experiments**
> If you spend an afternoon on one of your own goals, and it doesn’t provide value, that wasted time is on you. It’s as if you spent the afternoon playing video games. Once you realize that, it forces you to become more agentic, which has all kinds of benefits for your career.
