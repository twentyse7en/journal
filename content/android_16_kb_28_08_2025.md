# Android's 16KB Page Size Support Explained

Android is making a fundamental architectural shift by supporting 16KB memory page sizes starting with Android 15, moving away from the traditional 4KB pages used since Android's inception. **This change becomes mandatory for Google Play by November 1, 2025**, requiring all apps targeting Android 15+ to support the larger page size. While this delivers significant performance improvements of 5-10% system-wide and up to 30% faster app launches, it presents critical compatibility challenges for React Native developers and apps with native code.

The transition represents Android's evolution toward optimizing for modern devices with larger RAM capacities while leveraging ARM architecture capabilities for measurable improvements in app performance, system responsiveness, and power efficiency. However, developers must take immediate action to ensure their apps remain compatible with this architectural change.

## Understanding Memory Page Sizes on Android

Memory page size is the fundamental unit by which Android's operating system manages memory allocation and virtual address translation. Think of pages as fixed-size chunks that the OS uses to organize memory - every memory allocation request gets rounded up to page boundaries, and the Memory Management Unit (MMU) translates virtual addresses to physical addresses on a page-by-page basis.

Traditional Android devices have always used **4KB pages (4,096 bytes)**, which made sense for early devices with limited RAM. Each memory request gets allocated in multiples of 4KB, so requesting 1KB actually allocates 4KB, while requesting 5KB allocates 8KB across two pages. The system maintains page tables to track these virtual-to-physical address mappings, with the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) caching recent translations for performance.

**16KB pages (16,384 bytes)** fundamentally change this calculus. Now a 1KB request allocates a full 16KB page, while a 17KB request requires 32KB across two pages. While this increases memory overhead for small allocations, it dramatically reduces the bookkeeping overhead - the system needs **4x fewer page table entries** to manage the same amount of memory, resulting in fewer TLB misses and more efficient address translation.

## Traditional 4KB versus New 16KB Page Systems

The differences between 4KB and 16KB page systems extend far beyond simple size multiplication. **4KB pages** optimize for memory conservation, making them ideal for devices with 2-4GB RAM. They minimize memory waste for small allocations but create significant overhead - managing 1GB of memory requires 262,144 page table entries, putting pressure on the TLB and requiring more CPU cycles for address translation.

**16KB pages** flip this optimization toward performance over memory conservation. The same 1GB requires only 65,536 page table entries, reducing page table size by 75%. This translates to measurably faster memory operations, fewer page faults, and more efficient virtual memory management. Google's testing shows this architectural change delivers 3.16% average improvement in app launch times under memory pressure, with some applications seeing up to 30% faster launches.

The ARM64 architecture natively supports multiple "translation granules" including 4KB, 16KB, and 64KB pages. Android's implementation uses kernel configuration `CONFIG_ARM64_16K_PAGES=y` instead of the traditional `CONFIG_ARM64_4K_PAGES=y`, along with corresponding changes to support 16KB-aligned ELF binaries and runtime page size detection through `getpagesize()` instead of compile-time constants.

## Why Android is Embracing 16KB Pages

Google's decision to support 16KB pages stems from **measurable performance benefits** that address real user pain points. Their comprehensive testing across Pixel devices demonstrates **5-10% overall system performance improvements**, including:

- **8% faster boot times** (nearly a full second improvement)
- **4.56% reduction in power consumption** during app launches  
- **4.48-6.60% faster camera startup times**

The technical mechanisms driving these improvements center on reduced memory management overhead. With **4x fewer page table entries**, the system spends less CPU time translating virtual addresses, experiences fewer TLB misses, and can more efficiently manage large memory allocations common in modern applications. This is particularly beneficial for memory-intensive workloads like photography, video processing, and gaming.

**Modern Android devices increasingly ship with 8GB or more RAM**, making the ~9% memory overhead acceptable in exchange for substantial performance gains. Google recognizes that while 4KB pages optimized for memory-constrained early Android devices, today's hardware landscape benefits from the performance-first approach of larger page sizes.

The strategic timing also aligns with Android's evolution toward desktop-class experiences and AI/ML workloads that require efficient handling of large memory operations. This architectural change positions Android for future optimizations, potentially supporting even larger 64KB pages on devices with abundant RAM.
