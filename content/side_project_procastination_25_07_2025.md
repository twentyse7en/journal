# Addressing Procrastination on Your Side Project

## Intro
I'm creating a ios app as my sideproject. I'm excited, but still I'm struggling to finish the project. I asked claude 3.7 thinking about the struggle. I'm sharing a copy so I can visit again and for other fellow people how are struggling with sideprojects.

```
<role>
you are clinical psychologist, help me with my issues, suggest me advice
<role>

<problem>
I'm doing a side project, which I have high hopes. But It's not trivial task, have medium effort. But as it's a side project I generally slack, spend time on social media instead of doing task. Help me tackle this issue
<problem>
```
# Output
Thank you for sharing your struggle. Procrastination on meaningful side projects is extremely common, especially when the project requires significant effort but lacks the external accountability of work assignments.

## Understanding What's Happening

From a psychological perspective, you're experiencing what we call the "intention-action gap." You have high hopes and intentions for your project, but something is blocking the consistent action needed to make progress. This often happens because:

1. **Delayed gratification** - The rewards of completing your project feel distant compared to the immediate dopamine hit from social media
2. **Task aversion** - Starting complex tasks triggers discomfort that we naturally avoid
3. **Perfectionism** - High hopes can create pressure that makes starting feel overwhelming

## Practical Strategies

### 1. Implement Time-Blocking with Clear Boundaries

- **Specific time slots**: Schedule specific 25-45 minute blocks dedicated solely to your project
- **Physical boundaries**: Work in a different location from where you typically browse social media
- **Digital boundaries**: Use website blockers (like Freedom, Cold Turkey) during work sessions

### 2. Make Starting Incredibly Small

- **Two-minute rule**: Commit to just two minutes of project work initially - this overcomes the psychological barrier to starting
- **Process goals**: Focus on "I'll work for 30 minutes" rather than "I'll complete this feature"

### 3. Enhance Accountability and Motivation

- **Implementation intentions**: Create "if-then" plans like "If it's 7pm on Tuesday, then I'll work on my project for 30 minutes"
- **Progress visualization**: Keep a visible record of your work sessions to build momentum
- **Accountability partner**: Find someone to share regular updates with, even if they don't understand the technical aspects

### 4. Address Cognitive Patterns

- **Notice the avoidance cue**: What thought or feeling typically triggers the switch to social media?
- **Challenge perfectionistic thinking**: "Done is better than perfect" - remind yourself that progress matters more than perfection
- **Self-compassion**: Treat setbacks with understanding rather than harsh self-criticism

## Starting Today

1. Right now, decide on a specific 30-minute block tomorrow for project work
2. Set up your environment in advance (gather materials, block distractions)
3. Make the first task small and concrete

# My Actions
- I created a sheet to track my progress
- I have written down what to do next, so I don't need to think to start
- I have created small task, relatively easy to complete
- I have to do something to gratification part
