# Duolingo Handbook notes

Link to [handbook](https://handbook.duolingo.com/)

It's a good read if you planning to build something especially an App. One thing to appreaciate is the artwork in the book, it's really cool.
In this note, I will be only adding points which I felt relevant.

# Take the Long View
> put long term user retention first

# Raise the bar

> Every feature we ship must be intuitive, delightful, useful,
> and polished.
- They are well polished, that make them standout
> But these charactersâ€”inspired more by brands like Nintendo
> than traditional learning companiesâ€”also serve an important
> strategic purpose. We see this IP as a crucial moat for our
> business, especially in the era of AI learning tools. That same
> emotional connection that makes learning enjoyable also makes
> our product stickier over time. Even if someone cloned our
> entire app, learners would still come back to Duolingo for the
> characters.

Man this is huge, the confidence they have in their product is awesome. And I feel the hype is real.

> Polished: This is what makes a feature feel complete.
> Tight visual design, perfect copy, and seamless
> interactions are the baseline. Nothing should feel clunky
> or inconsistent. For instance, we shouldnâ€™t have both a
> Back button and an X button that do the same thing.


> Delightful: Every new feature needs to have some
> amount of fun and delight. We might not need the most
> elaborate animations in the first iteration of a feature,
> but there should always be a hint of the magic that
> learners love.

# Shit it
> We run hundreds of experiments each week in order to
> constantly improve our products and our organization.

This feels like very important, instead of product team keep assuming
about user behaviour and what they need, we can run a lot of experiment and find the way. Tech product have so much advantage like this compared to other fields, car manufactures can't risk like this!
> we test ideas quickly and only invest significant engineering resources when something is successful.

# Make It Fun
> Our product is built on play, using gamification and design to
> make learning fun.
Learning is something that is need to be done daily, they have streak for that. So they are not just competiting with other educational app, also other popular apps in users phone for his screen time. People mindlessly scroll instagram and youtube, Duolingo should be producing some amount of pleasure hormone. I feel like learning and pleasure are polar opposite, if they were able to pull this much amount of usuage then they are definitely doing some magic. From my own use case, A person usually have 8 hours of work, after which they will be tired and don't need to think for rest of the day and they could watch something and feel better, but instead of that they are opening duolingo for learning a language which need brain work and make you even more tired, but they won! cool ðŸ«¡

## Advertising
Good product also needs advertising.

>  But weâ€™ve also figured
> out how to use other levers, like performance marketing, to
> complement that organic growth. Our paid ads exist to amplify
> our word-of-mouth momentum, not replace it, so we are
> conservative with our spend. 

## The Green Machine
1. Staff It with Great People
2. Define Success

    We always want to set clear, measurable goalsâ€”whether itâ€™s
    DAUs, bookings, or social impressions. But metrics arenâ€™t always
    available for early-stage projects. In that case, we define the best
    available qualitative goals, iterate toward clarity, and keep an eye
    out for any useful signals.
3. Set Guardrails and Think Long-Term

    We use guardrails to ensure our work benefits both Duolingo
    and our learners over the long term. This aligns with our core
    principle, Take the Long View. Thoughtful guardrails help us
    focus on sustainable, meaningful growth, ensuring that each
    experiment serves a greater purpose.
4. Build the Thing and Set Up Feedback Loops
5. Execute with Urgency and Excellence

    Because of the compounding nature of smaller improvements,
    there is a huge cost to moving slowly. But moving too fast
    can also lead to sloppy outcomes. In step five, we work to
    continuously (and urgently) ship work that meets our bar.
6. Double Down on What Works, Stop What Doesnâ€™t

## Conclusion
It's was a good read, feels like need to revisit this multiple times.
