# Kotlin

At my current [company](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/udaan) backend folks are using [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). One guy said  kotlin is like java, but was more easier to write. Also in a kotlin project, if they need they can also directly write java files. That's all I recall from that conversation. I don't have any background in Java project, let's anyway explore some kotlin stuffs so I can understand what my backend engineer are writing.

# Origin
Jetbrain created kotlin. Ok, but why? they have IDE for java and other stuff, why would they want to create a language itself. How know the actual truth, fellow people on internet is saying,
> "JetBrains needed to create Kotlin because they build their whole business on the JVM and they need a better language to create their own products. It's as simple as that. That's why the compatibility story in Kotlin is so wonderful. They don't want to rewrite. They want to continue development." ~ nirataro [[1]]

That story seems to be true, backend people are using Jerbrains IDE. Enough history, let run smtg.

# Setup
Mine is a mac so
```sh
brew install kotlin
```
to run kotlin
```
kotlinc <filename>.kt -include-runtime -d output.jar
java -jar output.jar
```
I already have java installed.
