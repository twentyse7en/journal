# React Compiler

We don't need to explicitly write `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`, React compiler will add this for you. But you have to follow rules of React, there is also a eslint plugin that will help you with this. Is there any pitfall? what rules of react you might miss? I don't neither, I will checkout those.
