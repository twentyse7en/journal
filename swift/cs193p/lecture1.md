# Getting Started with SwiftUI

A very detailed explanation for hello world of swift ui, I like the level of details and items professor considered for understanding basic swift ui, which most of the online tutorials skip. If you know swift ui from youtube tutorials, then this will be a good course for fill the gaps, to have a better foundation.

### 1. Preview

*   **Purpose:** A struct (e.g., `ContentView_Previews`) that connects your UI code (e.g., `ContentView`) to the Xcode preview canvas.
*   It typically just instantiates your main `View` struct.
*   Generally, **not something to modify extensively** for app logic; primarily a development aid.
*   Can be moved to the bottom of the file to reduce clutter.

```swift
// Example of ContentView_Previews
// (Usually found at the bottom of a SwiftUI file)

// Assuming you have a ContentView defined like:
// struct ContentView: View {
//     var body: some View {
//         Text("Hello, SwiftUI!")
//     }
// }

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView() // Creates an instance of ContentView for the preview
    }
}

// modern approach with macro
#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```

### 2. `import SwiftUI`

*   **Function:** Similar to `include` (C/C++) or `import` (Python, Java). Makes SwiftUI framework features available.
*   **Usage:**
    *   **Required for ALL UI files.**
    *   **NOT used in non-UI files** (e.g., backend logic, data models).
        *   These might import `Foundation` instead (for basic types like `Array`, `Dictionary`).
*   **Separation of Concerns:** This enforces a clean separation between UI and logic.
*   Other frameworks can also be imported (e.g., `CoreData` for databases).

```swift
// At the top of any file that defines or uses SwiftUI Views
import SwiftUI

// In a non-UI file (e.g., for game logic):
// import Foundation // For basic types, not UI
```

### 3. `struct ContentView: View` - The Core UI Definition

*   **`struct` Keyword:**
    *   Defines a **structure**.
    *   In SwiftUI, structs are **fundamental** and the "heart of everything."
    *   Can contain variables (properties) and functions.
    *   **Crucial Distinction:** Structs in Swift are **NOT classes**. This is **NOT Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
        *   No inheritance from other custom structs in the same way classes inherit.
        *   Swift *has* a `class` keyword for OOP, but it will be used sparingly in this SwiftUI context.
*   **`ContentView` (Name):**
    *   This is the user-defined name for our structure type.
    *   Initially generic (e.g., `ContentView`), will be renamed to something more descriptive (e.g., `MemorizeGameView`).
*   **`: View` (Protocol Conformance):**
    *   **Key Concept: "Behaves Like"**
        *   The colon (`:`) here means `ContentView` **behaves like a `View`**.
        *   `View` is a **protocol** (a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality).
        *   This is central to **functional programming** (or "protocol-oriented programming") in SwiftUI. Focus is on **behavior/functionality**, not data encapsulation (as in OOP).
    *   **What is a `View` (protocol)?**
        *   A rectangular area on screen that draws something and can respond to events.
    *   **Implications of "Behaves Like a View":**
        1.  **Responsibility:** The struct *must* fulfill the requirements of the `View` protocol.
        2.  **Benefit:** The struct *gains all the capabilities* defined by the `View` protocol (hundreds of functions, massive functionality like colors, layout, etc.).
    *   **The Sole Requirement for `View` Conformance:**
        *   Must implement a specific computed property: `var body: some View`.

```swift
import SwiftUI

// Defines a new type 'ContentView' that is a struct
// and it promises to 'behave like' a View.
struct ContentView: View { // `: View` is the protocol conformance
    // ... (body property will go here)
    // This is a value type, not a reference type like a class.
    // No inheritance like: struct MyAdvancedView: ContentView {} (This is not how SwiftUI composition works)

    // It can have other properties and methods:
    var title: String = "My App"

    func doSomething() {
        print("Action performed!")
    }

    // The required 'body' property to fulfill the 'View' protocol:
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello from \(title)")
    }
}
```

### 4. `var body: some View` - The View's Content

*   **`var` Keyword:** Declares a variable (in Swift, properties of a struct/class).
*   **`body` (Name):** The specific name required by the `View` protocol.
*   **`{ ... }` (Code Block): Computed Property**
    *   This `body` property is a **computed property**.
    *   Its value is **not stored**; it's **calculated by executing the code within the curly braces `{...}` each time `body` is accessed.**
    *   It's "read-only" in the sense that you don't set it directly, but its value can change if the underlying code or state changes.
    *   Contrasts with "stored properties" (e.g., `var i: Int`) where a value is directly stored.
*   **`: some View` (Type):**
    *   The type of the `body` property.
    *   **Meaning:** The `body` property must return *some specific type* that itself conforms to the `View` protocol.
    *   The `some` keyword is an "opaque type." It tells Swift: "The code inside `body` will return a concrete `View` type, but we don't need to specify *which* concrete type here. Just infer it from the return value and ensure it *is* a `View`."
    *   The compiler checks that the code inside `body` indeed returns a valid `View`.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct MyExampleView: View {
    // Stored property (value is stored directly)
    var score: Int = 100
    var name: String = "Player One"

    // Computed property 'body' (value is calculated by the code in the braces)
    // The type is 'some View', meaning it returns *some* concrete type
    // that conforms to the View protocol (e.g., Text, VStack, etc.)
    var body: some View {
        // This code block is executed when 'body' is accessed.
        // It must return a single View.
        Text("Name: \(name), Score: \(score)")
        // If 'score' or 'name' changes and the view is redrawn,
        // 'body' is re-computed.
    }

    // Another example of a computed property (not related to View protocol necessarily)
    var scoreDescription: String {
        if score > 90 {
            return "Excellent!"
        } else {
            return "Good job!"
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. The Lego Analogy: Why `body` Returns `some View`

*   **Core Idea:** SwiftUI `View`s are compositional, like Lego bricks.
*   A complex `View` (e.g., a "HelicopterView") is built by assembling other, simpler `View`s (e.g., "RotorView," "AirframeView," "LandingGearView").
*   The `body` of your `ContentView` (or any custom `View`) defines *how* these smaller `View` "bricks" are combined to create the current `View`.
*   So, for `ContentView` to "behave like a View," its `body` must provide *the content of that View*, which is itself composed of other `View`s.
*   This allows for arbitrary complexity and hierarchical UI structures (e.g., `VStack`s, `HStack`s, `ZStack`s containing other `View`s).

```swift
import SwiftUI

// Imagine these are simple "Lego brick" Views
struct BrickView: View {
    var color: Color
    var body: some View {
        Rectangle()
            .fill(color)
            .frame(width: 50, height: 20)
    }
}

// This "ComplexLegoStructureView" is built from smaller "BrickView" Legos
struct ComplexLegoStructureView: View {
    var body: some View { // body returns 'some View'
        // The 'body' here is a VStack, which is a View that arranges other Views.
        // This VStack *is* the 'some View' that this body returns.
        VStack(spacing: 2) { // VStack is a View itself
            Text("My Lego Structure") // Text is a View
            BrickView(color: .red)     // BrickView is a View
            BrickView(color: .blue)    // BrickView is a View
            HStack { // HStack is a View
                BrickView(color: .green)
                BrickView(color: .yellow)
            }
        }
        // This entire VStack (containing Text and BrickViews) is the content
        // of ComplexLegoStructureView. It's one single composite View.
    }
}
```
Okay, here are the notes for the next section of the course video, focusing on creating structs, parameters, Stacks, ViewModifiers, and building the initial `CardView`.

### 7. Creating Instances of Structs & Parameters

*   **Syntax:** To create an instance of a struct (including Views), use its name followed by parentheses: `StructTypeName()`.
*   **Arguments/Parameters:**
    *   Structs are initialized with arguments passed inside the parentheses.
    *   **Named Parameters:** Many initializers use named parameters for clarity, especially when there are multiple parameters or their meaning isn't obvious from the type alone.
        *   Example: `Image(systemName: "globe")` - `systemName` is the parameter label.
    *   **Unnamed Parameters:** Some initializers for simple structs might omit the label for the primary argument if its purpose is clear.
        *   Example: `Text("Hello, World!")` - The string is the direct, unnamed argument.
    *   **Multiple Initializers:** A single struct (like `Image`) can have multiple ways to be initialized (different sets of named parameters) to handle various use cases (e.g., system SF Symbol vs. an image from app assets).
        *   `Image(systemName: "...")` vs. `Image("myAssetNameInAssets")`
*   **Parameter Defaults:**
    *   Initializer parameters can have default values. If a default is provided, you don't *have* to supply that argument when creating an instance; the default will be used.
    *   Example: `VStack()` uses default alignment and spacing. `VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 10)` overrides these defaults.

```swift
// Creating instances of built-in Views
let myImage = Image(systemName: "heart.fill") // Named parameter 'systemName'
let myText = Text("Some informative text")     // Unnamed parameter (the string itself)

// VStack with default parameters
VStack { /* content */ }

// VStack specifying parameters (overriding defaults)
VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 20) { /* content */ }
```

### 8. Container Views (`VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`) & Trailing Closure Syntax

*   `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack` are structs that conform to `View`. They arrange other Views vertically, horizontally, or overlaid (depth-wise), respectively.
*   **Content via Trailing Closure:** The child Views they contain are provided within a pair of curly braces `{}` immediately following the Stack's initialization.
    ```swift
    VStack { // This { ... } is a trailing closure
        Text("Item 1")
        Image(systemName: "star")
    }
    ```
*   **Under the Hood (The "Bag of Legos"):**
    1.  This `{...}` block is actually a **closure** (an anonymous function) being passed as an argument to the Stack's initializer.
    2.  The full, explicit syntax would be something like: `VStack(content: { Text("Item 1"); Image(systemName: "star") })`.
    3.  Swift's **trailing closure syntax** allows you to write the closure outside the parentheses if it's the *last* argument to a function/initializer. If it's the *only* argument (after defaults), the parentheses can often be omitted.
    4.  **`@ViewBuilder`:** The `content` parameter of these Stacks (and the `body` property of a `View`) is typically marked with `@ViewBuilder`. This special attribute allows you to list multiple Views directly within the closure. The `@ViewBuilder` then internally packages this list of Views into a single composite View (often a `TupleView`).
        *   A `TupleView` is like an invisible container holding a sequence of views; it requires a proper layout container (like `VStack`) to arrange them visually.
    5.  **What's allowed inside a `@ViewBuilder` block:**
        *   A list of Views.
        *   Conditional logic (`if`, `if/else`, `switch`).
        *   Declaration of local variables.
        *   *Not* arbitrary calculations or complex imperative code directly between View declarations (that logic should be elsewhere or within a View's own properties/methods).

### 9. View Modifiers

*   **Definition:** Functions called on a View instance that alter its appearance or behavior and **return a new, modified View**.
*   **Chaining:** Because modifiers return a View, you can chain them together. The order often matters.
    ```swift
    Text("Styled Text")
        .font(.title)                 // Returns a View with a title font
        .foregroundColor(.blue)       // Returns a View (from .font) now with blue text
        .padding()                    // Returns a View (from .foregroundColor) now with padding
    ```
*   **Common Modifiers:** `.font()`, `.foregroundColor()`, `.padding()`, `.background()`, `.frame()`, `.imageScale()`, etc. There are hundreds available.
*   **Availability:** These are part of the functionality gained by conforming to the `View` protocol.
*   **Scoping & Propagation:**
    *   Modifiers applied to a container View (like `VStack`) can affect all child Views within it, if those children don't have their own conflicting modifier for the same property.
        *   Example: `VStack { ... }.font(.headline)` makes all text inside the `VStack` use the headline font unless a specific `Text` view inside sets its own `.font()`.
    *   Some modifiers are specific to certain View types (e.g., `.imageScale()` for `Image`). If applied to an incompatible View (e.g., `.imageScale()` on a `Text` view), they are typically ignored by that View.

```swift
Image(systemName: "globe")
    .imageScale(.large)
    .foregroundColor(.green)
    .padding() // Applies padding around the green, large globe

VStack {
    Text("Hello")
    Text("World")
}
.font(.largeTitle) // Both "Hello" and "World" will be largeTitle
.foregroundColor(.orange) // Both will be orange
```

### 10. Building a Custom `CardView` (Refactoring & Composition)

*   **Motivation:** To avoid code duplication (copy-pasting UI for multiple cards) and to create a reusable, understandable UI component.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Define a new `struct` that conforms to `View` (e.g., `struct CardView: View`).
    2.  Implement its `var body: some View` property.
    3.  Move the UI logic for a single card (e.g., the `ZStack` with `RoundedRectangle` and `Text`) into `CardView`'s `body`.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Readability:** `ContentView`'s `body` becomes simpler (e.g., `HStack { CardView(); CardView() }`).
    *   **Maintainability:** Changes to a card's appearance are made in one place (`CardView`).
    *   **Reusability:** `CardView` can be used anywhere.
*   **Goal: Keep `body` short:** Aim for `body` (and other functions/computed vars) to be < 20 lines, ideally < 12, by breaking down complex UIs into smaller, custom Views.

```swift
// In ContentView.swift

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            CardView(isFaceUp: true, content: "👻")
            CardView(isFaceUp: false, content: "🚀")
            CardView(isFaceUp: true, content: "🤖")
            CardView(isFaceUp: false, content: "👽")
        }
        .padding()
        .foregroundColor(.orange) // Default back color for cards
    }
}

// Define the custom CardView struct (can be in the same file or a new one)
struct CardView: View {
    var isFaceUp: Bool = true // Parameter with a default value
    var content: String       // Parameter for the card's face emoji

    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            let shape = RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12)
            if isFaceUp {
                shape.fill(.white) // White background for face-up card
                shape.strokeBorder(lineWidth: 2) // Border for face-up card
                Text(content).font(.largeTitle)
            } else {
                shape.fill() // Uses foregroundColor from environment (e.g., orange) for back
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 11. Adding Parameters to Custom Views

*   Custom Views (`CardView`) can have their own stored properties (e.g., `var isFaceUp: Bool`, `var content: String`).
*   These properties become parameters for the View's initializer.
*   **Initialization Rule:** All non-optional stored properties of a struct *must* have a value by the time initialization is complete. This means they either:
    1.  Have a default value assigned in their declaration (e.g., `var isFaceUp: Bool = false`).
    2.  Are assigned a value through an initializer argument (e.g., `CardView(isFaceUp: true, content: "A")`).
*   When a property is added, call sites need to be updated to provide arguments for it, unless it has a default.
*   These parameters can then be used within the custom View's `body` to alter its appearance or behavior (e.g., using `if isFaceUp { ... } else { ... }`).

### 12. Shapes (`Rectangle`, `RoundedRectangle`)

*   SwiftUI provides primitive `Shape` types like `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `RoundedRectangle`, `Capsule`, `Ellipse`.
*   Shapes are `View`s themselves.
*   `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: CGFloat)` is commonly used for card-like UIs.
*   **Filling and Stroking:**
    *   Shapes can be filled: `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10).fill(.blue)` or `.foregroundColor(.blue)` (fill is often the default).
    *   Shapes can be stroked: `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10).stroke(.red, lineWidth: 3)`.
    *   `strokeBorder(...)` strokes *inside* the shape's bounds, which is often preferred for crisp edges.
    *   **Limitation:** You cannot *directly* both fill and stroke the *same shape instance* in one go.
    *   **Workaround:** Use a `ZStack` to layer two shapes: one filled, and another one (same geometry) stroked on top or behind.

```swift
// Example of filling and stroking a RoundedRectangle
ZStack {
    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 20)
        .fill(.white) // The filled background
    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 20)
        .strokeBorder(.blue, lineWidth: 3) // The border on top
    Text("Content")
}
```

### 13. Xcode Preview Variants & Environment

*   **Preview Variants Button:** (Bottom of Preview canvas) Allows quick checks for:
    *   **Color Scheme:** Light vs. Dark Mode.
    *   **Orientation:** Portrait vs. Landscape.
    *   **Dynamic Type:** Different user-preferred font sizes.
*   **Environment Modifiers:** For more persistent preview settings or for device testing:
    *   Apply modifiers like `.environment(\.colorScheme, .dark)` to your top-level previewed View in `ContentView_Previews` to force dark mode for the preview.
*   **Designing for Adaptability:** Essential to ensure UI looks good and functions correctly across various device settings and appearances.

```swift
// In ContentView_Previews to test dark mode for ContentView
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
            .preferredColorScheme(.dark) // Preferred way for previews
        // or .environment(\.colorScheme, .dark) for older syntax/more control
    }
}
```
