- Acts as the app's entry point and handles app lifecycle events.
- Automatically created in Xcode projects.

2. Handles system notifications (e.g., memory warnings, time changes).
3. Sets up initial app configuration (e.g., root view controller, third-party libraries).
4. Responds to app state transitions.

## **Key Methods**
1. `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` - App finishes launching.
2. `applicationWillResignActive(_:)` - App is about to become inactive.
3. `applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)` - App enters the background.
4. `applicationWillEnterForeground(_:)` - App is about to enter the foreground.
5. `applicationWillTerminate(_:)` - App is about to terminate.

2. **Deep Links**: Manage deep linking and URL handling.
3. **Third-Party Integrations**: Initialize libraries like Firebase, Analytics, or Crashlytics.
4. **App Configuration**: Set up app-wide settings or themes.
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Handle app state changes (e.g., save data before termination).
